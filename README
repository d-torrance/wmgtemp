wmgtemp is a dock app intended for use with WindowMaker.
It displays the CPU and SYS temperatures (both in numerically and 
graphically) of motherboards that use the VIA686A chipset. Currently 
this is the only chipset that is supported but I have the intention of
adding support for other chipsets in the future.

Interface Features:
	Clicking on the temperature toggles displaying of maximum reached
	temperature. This mode is indicated by a green upward pointing
	arrow to the left of the temperature.

	Clicking on CPU or SYS toggles displaying of that temperature
	type on the graph. The temperature value will still be displayed
	numerically however.

	Clicking on the Graph area will cycle through the graph types.

	When the bounds of the graph are exceeded the graph will be rescaled
	the show the current temperature and a line will be drawn to indicate
	the bound(red for upper bound, blue for lower bound). As soon as
	all temperatures being displayed are within a bound, the graph will
	be rescaled back to normal size.

Supported Sensors:
	  VIA686A
	  W83781D
	  W83627HF
	  AS99127F
	  ADM1021

	  The only sensors that I have personally tested this app with is
	  the VIA686A. Any other sensors are either guesses or submitted
	  by other users. If you have any problems with any sensors
	  let me know and i'll see what I can do.
