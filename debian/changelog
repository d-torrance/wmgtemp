wmgtemp (0.6-1.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload, to recompile against proper libsensors-dev
    and eliminate obsoleted libsensors1 dependency, closes: #197022.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Jun 2003 19:00:47 +0200

wmgtemp (0.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload, approved by the maintainer.
  * Recompiled against the new libsensors-dev, plus a little patch
    to remove a multi-line string in printf which doesn't work with
    new GCC, closes: #191538.
  * Updated upstream URL, closes: #185514.
  * Removed the duplication in the manual page and (after cross-checking)
    merged it into the upstream file, closes: #185513.
  * Remove mention of chips from the description since that code was
    removed, it's now generic.
  * Use temp1 for system and temp2 for processor temperature with via686a,
    like the old version did, closes: #185512.
    I've got an Abit KG7, the author has Abit KT7 -- these two boards should
    have the same south bridge (VIA 686B), so if the settings really differ,
    then the whole idea of guessing which sensor is which seems rather
    pointless :(
