Description: Temperature sensor dockapp for Window Maker
 wmgtemp is a dock app (a 64x64 window) which graphically displays the
 CPU and SYS temperatures of motherboards supported by lm_sensors.
 .
 To make wmgtemp work, one needs to set up lm_sensors and I2C.
 On Debian systems, the lm-sensors-source and i2c-source packages
 are used to set these up.
