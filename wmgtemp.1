.SH NAME
wmgtemp \- Temperature sensor dock app for Window Maker
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmgtemp
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
wmgtemp is a dock-app for Window Maker that graphically displays the CPU and System temperatures using the lm_sensors package. It was originally intended to work with the VIA686A chipset but also supports some other sensors. It displays the CPU and System temperature values, a scaling graph of temperature history, high-temperature warning lights and temperatures in celcius, fahrenheit or kelvin.
.PP
The temperature graph is auto scaling, meaning that if the max or min temperature boundary is crossed the graph will be scaled to display the temperature. A red line marks the upper boundary whereas a blue line indicates the lower boundary. When all the temperatures being displayed are within the boundaries the graph will be scaled back to the preset values for min/max and the boundary indicator lines will be removed.
.PP
The high temperature warning lights located on the left of the temperature type indicators show amber or red when the warning or high temperatures are reached respectively. Normal operating temperature is indicated by no light.

.SH USAGE
.SS Graph
You can cycle through the graph types by clicking on the graph display area.
.PP
.SS High Temperature Toggle
You can toggle the displaying of high temperatures by click on the temperature for the corrosponding temperature. The viewing of high temperatures is indicated by an amber arrow to the left of the temperature. The current temperatures will continue to be displayed on the graph.
.PP
.SH
.SS Temperature display TOGGLE
You may toggle the displaying of a temperature on the graph by clicking on the corrosponding type. e.g To toggle the display of the CPU temperature click on CPU. The type indicator (CPU or SYS) will disappear and the temperature will not be displayed on the graph, although the temperature value will continue to be displayed.
.PP
.SH
.SS Temperature Scale Cycling
You may change the scale the temperatures are displayed in by clicking on either of the CPU or SYS scale indicators. The cycle order is \fBC\fP -> \fBK\fP -> \fBF\fP
.PP
.SH SUPPORTED SENSORS
VIA686A, W83781D, W83627HF, AS99127F, ADM1021
